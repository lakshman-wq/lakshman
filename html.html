                <strong>DESCRIPTION</strong>
                <p>This project presents the development of an AI and ML-based system designed to monitor and analyze upper body movements in real time. The Upper Body Detector leverages advanced computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms to detect, track, and assess user posture during exercises. Targeted primarily at fitness environments such as gyms, this tool enables users to visualize their form and performance live on screen.

                    The system captures the user’s upper body movements, analyzing pose and form to ensure exercises are performed correctly. With features such as repetition counting and posture assessment, it provides instant feedback to improve technique and prevent injuries. For beginners, this helps in learning the correct exercise forms, while for advanced users, it supports fine-tuning of their workout routines. Additionally, trainers can utilize the data generated to tailor their guidance to individual needs, enhancing the personalization of fitness instruction</p>
